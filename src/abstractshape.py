# Additionally, it must define the following:
#   Relevant geometry - position, size, etc
#   Sampling distributions - potentially 2 such as x,y or radius, angle
#   Clip = a bool of whether a sampled point is clipped to gurantee it is within the shape or not
#       For example, a standard normal distribution may be the internal sampling distribution, which can technically output a point from -inf to inf.
#       Therefore, we may want to clip the points to always be within the shape
